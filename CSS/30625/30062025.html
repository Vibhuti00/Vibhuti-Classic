            <h5 >The Mars orbiter that boosted India's planetary program</h5>
            <p>Mangalyaan was India's Mars orbiter that observed the planet from 2014 to 2022.</p>
            <p>The mission was India's first to another planet, and a major step forward for India's space program.</p>

            <h2 align="center">India Launch Mangalyaan</h2>
            <p>On November 5, 2013, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched its first spacecraft bound for Mars. India built Mangalyaan (“Mars craft” in English) to study the Red Planet and test key technologies required for exploring the inner Solar System. The Mangalyaan spacecraft successfully entered Mars orbit on September 23, 2014, making ISRO only the fourth space agency in the world to do so. Prior to India, only the United States, the Soviet Union and the European Space Agency (ESA) had successfully explored Mars.</p>
            <p>Mangalyaan operated for seven and a half years, observing Martian landscapes and studying their composition using its five science instruments.</p>

                <h2 align="center">National Response</h2>
                <p>The fact that ISRO successfully placed a spacecraft in Mars orbit on their very first attempt garnered attention and praise from people worldwide. In India, the mission had even deeper effects, aided by ISRO's inaugural efforts to be active on social media to make people at large aware of the mission.</p>
                <p>The mission saw several film and TV show adaptations in India, the most popular of which was the dramatized movie Mission Mangal. The national government decided to feature an illustration of Mangalyaan on the reverse side of India's highest denomination currency note of ₹2,000 (roughly $27). Writer Minnie Vaid wrote a book called "Those Magnificent Women and their Flying Machines," which profiles the journeys of some of the key women who had leading roles in the mission.</p>

            <h2 align="center">Future Missions</h2>
            <p>With the experience gained from Mangalyaan and technologies built for it, ISRO is planning more missions to explore the inner Solar system, such as the Venus Orbiter Mission and Mangalyaan 2, which could launch as early as 2026 with an upgraded bus and 100 kilograms (about 220 pounds) of scientific instruments. ISRO also recently launched the Aditya-L1 solar observatory.</p>

            <p>Mars Orbiter Mission caught this global view of Mars soon after arriving in orbit, on September 28, 2014, from an altitude of 74582 kilometers.</p>

            <h2 align="center">Mission End</h2>
            <p>In April 2022, ISRO lost contact with Mangalyaan after it passed into Mars' shadow for an extended period. Officials said the spacecraft likely ran out of propellant and could not orient its solar panels properly to receive power. The mission far outlived its projected six-month lifespan.</p>
